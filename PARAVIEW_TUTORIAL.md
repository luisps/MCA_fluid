---

### Step 3.1: Add Stream Tracer Filter

1. Select `output_..vti` in Pipeline Browser (the original data)
2. **Filters ‚Üí Common ‚Üí Stream Tracer**
3. Properties panel opens with many options

---

### Step 3.2: Configure Seed Points

Seed points are where streamlines start. Set:

**Seed Type**: Select **"Point Source"** (dropdown)

**Center**: `[10, 32, 32]`
- This places seeds upstream (x=10), center height (y=32), center depth (z=32)

**Radius**: `20`
- Seeds spread in sphere of radius 20

**Number of Points**: `100`
- Creates 100 streamlines

---

### Step 3.3: Configure Integration

Scroll down in Properties:

**Integration Direction**: **FORWARD** (flows downstream only)

**Integrator Type**: **Runge-Kutta 4-5** (accurate)

**Maximum Streamline Length**: `500`
- Lines stop after traveling 500 units

**Maximum Steps**: `2000` (default is usually fine)

**Click "Apply"**

‚úÖ **Check**: You see lines flowing from left to right!

---

### Step 3.4: Color by Velocity

Show flow speed:

1. Select **"StreamTracer1"** in Pipeline Browser
2. Change coloring to **"velocity"** or **"velocity_magnitude"**
3. Choose colormap: **"Cool to Warm"** or **"jet"**

**Color meaning:**
- **Blue**: Slow flow (~0-2 m/s)
- **Green/Yellow**: Medium flow (~3-4 m/s)
- **Red**: Fast flow (~5+ m/s)

‚úÖ **Check**: Streamlines show different colors indicating speed

---

### Step 3.5: Make Lines Thicker

If lines are too thin to see:

**Option A**: Increase Line Width
1. In Properties, find **"Line Width"**
2. Set to **2** or **3**

**Option B**: Use Tube Representation
1. Change **"Representation"** from "Surface" to **"Tubes"**
2. Set **"Radius"**: 0.5

‚úÖ **Check**: Streamlines are now visible and easy to follow

---

### Step 3.6: Add More Streamlines (Optional)

Create streamlines for all three smoke streams:

**For cylinder stream:**
1. Select `output_..vti` again
2. Add new Stream Tracer
3. Center: `[10, 20, 20]` (lower position)

**For upper stream:**
1. Add another Stream Tracer
2. Center: `[10, 48, 32]` (upper position)

Now you have streamlines matching all three smoke streams!

---

### üéì What You Learned

‚úÖ Use Stream Tracer filter  
‚úÖ Configure seed points  
‚úÖ Color by vector fields  
‚úÖ Adjust streamline appearance

## What to Observe

### Phenomenon 1: Von K√°rm√°n Vortex Street

**Where**: Behind cylinder obstacle

**What to see**:
- Alternating vortices (left-right-left-right pattern)
- Regular spacing and frequency
- Vortices travel downstream

**Best view**: Top-down slice through middle of cylinder

**Timesteps**: 100-500 (after initial startup)

---

### Phenomenon 2: Flow Separation

**Where**: At obstacle surfaces

**What to see**:
- Smoke/streamlines detach from surface
- Separation point on cylinder: ~120¬∞ from front
- Creates recirculation zone behind obstacle

**Best view**: Side view with streamlines

**Timesteps**: 50-150 (watch it develop)

---

### Phenomenon 3: Wake Turbulence

**Where**: Region downstream of obstacles

**What to see**:
- Chaotic smoke patterns
- Mixing of different flow speeds
- Lower velocity (blue colors on streamlines)
- Smoke accumulation

**Best view**: Smoke density animation

**Timesteps**: 150+ (fully developed turbulence)

---

### Phenomenon 4: Cylinder vs Sphere Comparison

**Cylinder**:
- 2D-like flow (consistent along height)
- Strong, regular vortex shedding
- Sharp periodic pattern

**Sphere**:
- 3D flow structures
- More complex vortex patterns
- Less regular shedding

**Best view**: Split screen showing both simultaneously

---

### Phenomenon 5: Boundary Layer

**Where**: Very close to obstacle surfaces

**What to see**:
- Velocity drops from 5 m/s to near zero
- Thin layer of slow-moving fluid
- Enhanced drag effect makes it thicker

**Best view**: Velocity contours with tight spacing near walls

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't see anything in ParaView

**Solution**:
1. Click **Apply** button (very common mistake!)
2. Check eye icons (üëÅ) are enabled
3. Click **Reset Camera** (camera might be pointing wrong direction)
4. Rescale colors to data range (‚ü≤ icon)

---

### Problem: Colors look wrong

**Solutions**:
- Click **‚ü≤** (Rescale to Data Range)
- Try different colormap (Rainbow, Jet, Viridis)
- Check you're coloring by correct field (density, not obstacle)
- Adjust opacity if too transparent

---

### Problem: Streamlines don't show

**Solutions**:
- Check **Maximum Streamline Length** isn't too small (use 500)
- Verify **Seed Type** is Point Source with reasonable radius
- Make sure **Integration Direction** is FORWARD
- Increase **Number of Points** to 100+
- Check data actually has velocity field (it should)

---

### Problem: Animation is choppy

**Solutions**:
- Reduce output frequency: run with `-o 20` instead of `-o 10`
- Use smaller grid: `-n 32` instead of `-n 64`
- Close other applications (free up memory)
- Simplify visualization (hide smoke, show only streamlines)

---

### Problem: Obstacles not visible

**Solutions**:
- Use Contour filter with **isosurface = 0.5**
- Make sure you selected "obstacle" field
- Change to **Solid Color** and pick contrasting color (gray)
- Increase **Opacity** to 1.0 (fully opaque)

---

### Problem: Everything is transparent

**Solutions**:
- Select each item in Pipeline Browser
- Set **Opacity** to 1.0 for all
- Or use **Volume** representation for smoke
- Check **Representation** isn't set to "Outline"

---

### Problem: Can't see smoke behind obstacles

**Solutions**:
- Reduce **obstacle opacity** to 0.7-0.8 (slightly transparent)
- Reduce **smoke opacity** to 0.3-0.5
- Use **Volume** rendering for smoke
- Rotate view to angle where both are visible

---

### Problem: File won't load

**Solutions**:
- Check files exist: `ls build/output_*.vti`
- Make sure simulation completed successfully
- Try loading single file first: `output_0100.vti`
- Check file isn't corrupted (size > 0 bytes)
